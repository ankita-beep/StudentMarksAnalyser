   ## AI Assistance Disclosure

This project was developed with the help of AI tools.
The AI was used as a coding assistant for structure and logic guidance.

I personally:
- Ran and tested the code locally
- Understood and verified the logic
- Modified inputs and validated outputs
- Managed the Git repository and commits

The goal of this project is learning and demonstrating Java fundamentals.
